## RELEASE STEPS
Change all version codes to newest version (i.e. search v7 in every file, and update it to v8)
Change manifest file name versions as well

## **WHAT TO EXPECT**
1. Day 0 (you deploy v6):
> New filenames + manifest.v6.json + bump CACHE_NAME in SW.
2. Minutes–hours later:
> Chrome re-fetches the manifest and sees new icon filenames.
3. Within ~24h (often sooner):
> Installed app’s tile icon & splash update automatically on Android.
