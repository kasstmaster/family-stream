Add animated welcome screen (in placement of first loading screen before profile modal) while everything pre-profile select loads.

SRT = Subtitles files - How to have video player recognize: Cannot do this because we would have to move from the drive player to a native <video> player, which requires drive to be public. Only way to do this would be:
Mux them in (burn or embed into the file)
	•	Use something like FFmpeg to merge subs directly into the MP4 as a caption track.
	•	Google Drive might then expose the CC button in their player.
	•	Downside: you have to re-encode every file that needs captions.
