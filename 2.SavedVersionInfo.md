SAVED CODE BEFORE THESE CHANGES

Hypothetical “smarter” way
Keep a Google Sheet as a library database.
Each row = one title (with title, poster, file IDs, etc.).
This becomes your app’s main source of truth, instead of Drive itself.
When you add a new file/folder in Drive:
A small script notices the new file.
It just adds that one new row in the sheet.
When you use the app:
It just reads from the sheet (super lightweight).
No Drive scanning needed unless something new is added.

Add animated welcome screen (in placement of first loading screen before profile modal) while everything pre-profile select loads.

SRT = Subtitles files - How to have video player recognize: Cannot do this because we would have to move from the drive player to a native <video> player, which requires drive to be public. Only way to do this would be:
Mux them in (burn or embed into the file)
	•	Use something like FFmpeg to merge subs directly into the MP4 as a caption track.
	•	Google Drive might then expose the CC button in their player.
	•	Downside: you have to re-encode every file that needs captions.
