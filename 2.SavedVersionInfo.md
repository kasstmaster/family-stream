Workarounds

Force direct-play: Skip Drive’s transcoder by using the download link instead of /preview.
Change the URL pattern in your Sheet-reader function from: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/${id}/preview` to `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=${id}&export=download`
Then, in your web app, load it in a <video controls> tag instead of embedding the Drive player iframe. That way the browser plays the raw MP4 directly (no Google processing needed).
Re-encode audio to stereo: If you really want Drive’s preview player working, try re-encoding the file with AAC stereo (-c:v copy -c:a aac -ac 2). Smaller audio complexity makes Drive more likely to finish.
Split the file: Huge files sometimes choke Drive. Splitting them into <2GB chunks can help, though it’s clunkier.

Add animated welcome screen (in placement of first loading screen before profile modal) while everything pre-profile select loads.

SRT = Subtitles files - How to have video player recognize: Cannot do this because we would have to move from the drive player to a native <video> player, which requires drive to be public. Only way to do this would be:
Mux them in (burn or embed into the file)
	•	Use something like FFmpeg to merge subs directly into the MP4 as a caption track.
	•	Google Drive might then expose the CC button in their player.
	•	Downside: you have to re-encode every file that needs captions.
