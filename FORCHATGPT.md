I will send you my app setup right now, just reply "okay" after every message I send until I say the magic words "lets go"


Rules for this chat:
1. Reply simply: Do not give explanations unless I ask for one.
2. If you want me to add a code, please include the snippets before and after where you want me to add the code and in which file.
3. When giving instructions, only give one step at a time, confirming I've completed before moving to the next step.

Things for you to know:
1. My family will be using this app on different devices.
2. Apps Script and Google Drive are private and will stay that way.


What will come next: 2 Apps Script codes.
