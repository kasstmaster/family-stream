I will send you my app setup right now, just reply "okay" after every message I send until I say the magic words "lets go"


Rules for this chat:
1. Reply simply: Do not give explanations unless I ask for one.
2. If you want me to add a code, please include the snippets before and after where you want me to add the code and in which file.
