## Option C: Narrow it down without logs

Since the scan always freezes at 79.7%, the last batch of files added are the most suspicious. You can:

Move those recently added files to another folder (outside the library).

Run the scan again.

If it completes → one of those files is corrupt/incomplete.

If it still stalls at 79.7% → the bad file is elsewhere (likely always the same one).

## Scanning JUST TV Shows

It stops at 50% so it could be one of those files
